Below is software that you can find to enhance your entertainment experience. Items marked as 👑 are recommended by me.

## 🖲 Trackers
###### TV shows and movies

- [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com): Good tracker, mainly available on android, and has a webapp. Plus has a social media aspect to it with reviews and comments on each movie/show from different users.
- [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv): 👑 Very good tracker, best used when integrated with your media players such as Plex (premium) and Jellyfin (free). Trakt also has alot of third party (free and paid) clients, personally I use [Showly](https://github.com/michaldrabik/showly-2.0) which is open source right here on GitHub. Check out my Trakt profile [here](https://trakt.tv/users/crxssed)
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net): A very good Anime tracker.
- [AniList](https://anilist.co): 👑 My choice when it comes to anime trackers. Works really well with [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org) and has a wide variety of clients that you can use.

###### Books
- [League of Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/): A comic tracker for both desktop (website) and mobile. The website is very nice and clean looking (pity it isn't a PWA), and the new app is really nice to use. Major downside is the fact that it doesn't have an API, so cannot be integrated with other applications.
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net): Listed in [TV shows and movies](#tv-shows-and-movies), but I'm also going to list it here as it has the ability to track manga too.
- [AniList](https://anilist.co): 👑 Similar to [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net).
- [Libib](https://www.libib.com): 👑 A great webapp to track your physical collections. Supports books (incl. manga and comics), movies, music and video games.
- [Bookshelf](https://www.bookshelfapp.info): Exclusively for mobile unfortunately, however it has a really clean interface, very easy to use, and all book metadata is editable (author, cover, etc).
- [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com): The most popular book tracker.

## ▶ Media players and servers
###### Servers

- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org): 👑 Server software that allows you to have all of your downloaded media (inc tv shows, movies, books, comics) available in one place, anywhere you go.
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/): Very similar to Jellyfin, however its all managed by central servers owned by Plex Inc, which I'm not a fan of. Also Jellyfin has more customizability, but Plex is more stable. 
- [Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/): 👑 Server software similar to that of Plex and Jellyfin, but just for books and comics. Con: seems like the origin developer has "abandoned" the project, and is not open source.
- [Emby](https://emby.media/): Similar to Plex and Jellyfin, however I've never used it personally.
- [Komga](https://komga.org/): Like Ubooquity, but just for comics. It can read epub files, but cannot read the contents, just the images - one way around it is just to convert all your epub files to pdf.
- [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com): 👑 Aims to be a direct modern replacement for Ubooquity. Quite a new project, however is very promising.

###### Players

- [Jellyfin Apps](https://jellyfin.org/clients/): 👑 Jellyfin provides a range of free software to play your media.
- [Plex Apps](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/media-server-downloads/#plex-app): Same as Jellyfin, but many of them are not free.
- [Ubooquity Webapp](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/): Ubooquity has it's own webapp built in to the server software, same with Jellyfin and Plex.
- [Komga Webapp](https://komga.org/): Follows the exact same concept as the Ubooquity Webapp.
- [Kuboo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sethchhim.kuboo&hl=en_GB&gl=US): 👑 Reader for Ubooquity, available for android.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/): Meant to be a very good comic reader. Apparently has functionality to be both a player and a server. Personally I wasn't very fond of it.
- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org): 👑 Quite possibly the best comic reader I have ever come across. The app itself is nothing but a container for all the extensions that you can install that allow you to read comics/manga from different sources.
- [Aniyomi](https://aniyomi.jmir.xyz): 👑 A fork of Tachiyomi with added functionality for anime as well.
