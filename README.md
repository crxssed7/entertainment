Below is software that you can find to enhance your entertainment experience. Items marked as 👑 are recommended by me.

## 🖲 Trackers
**TV shows and movies**

- [TelePeeps](https://kitric.github.io/projects/telepeeps/): 👑 Best tracker of course (not because it was developed by me 😂)
- [TV Time](https://www.tvtime.com): Good tracker, mainly available on android, and has a webapp. Plus has a social media aspect to it with reviews and comments on each movie/show from different users.
- [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv): 👑 Very good tracker, best used when integrated with your media players such as Plex (premium) and Jellyfin (free). Trakt also has alot of third party (free and paid) clients, personally I use [Showly](https://github.com/michaldrabik/showly-2.0) which is open source right here on GitHub. Check out my Trakt profile [here](https://trakt.tv/users/crxssed)
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net): From what I heard, a very good Anime tracker. I don't watch anime, so I can't judge 🤷‍♂️

**Comics**
- [Comic Tracker](https://github.com/crxssed7/comics-cli): A CLI application I developed that allows you to add comics to your collection, and mark certain issues as read.
- [League of Comic Geeks](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/): 👑 A comic tracker for both desktop (website) and mobile. The website is very nice and clean looking (pity it isn't a webapp), however the mobile app can be a bit laggy and glitchy, and in some cases hard to use. The website alone makes it a very recommended service, though.
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net): Listed in [TV shows and movies](https://github.com/crxssed7/entertainment#-trackers), but I'm also going to list it here as it has the ability to track manga too.

**Books**
- [Bookshelf](https://www.bookshelfapp.info): 👑 Exclusively for mobile unfortunately, however it has a really clean interface, very easy to use, and all book metadata is editable (author, cover, etc).
- [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com): The most popular book tracker, I've not used it enough to judge it accurately.

## ▶ Media players and servers
**Servers**

- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org): 👑 Server software that allows you to have all of your downloaded media (inc tv shows, movies, books, comics) available in one place, anywhere you go.
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/): Very similar to Jellyfin, however its all managed by central servers owned by Plex Inc, which I'm not a fan of. Also Jellyfin has more customizability, but Plex is more stable. 
- [Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/): 👑 Server software similar to that of Plex and Jellyfin, but just for books and comics. I prefer to split my media in three, Jellyfin for shows and movies, Ubooquity for books, and Komga for comics.
- [Emby](https://emby.media/): Similar to Plex and Jellyfin, however I've never used it personally.
- [Komga](https://komga.org/): 👑 Like Ubooquity, but just for comics. It can read epub files, but cannot read the contents, just the images - one way around it is just to convert all your epub files to pdf.

**Players**

- [Jellyfin Apps](https://jellyfin.org/clients/): 👑 Jellyfin provides a range of free software to play your media.
- [Plex Apps](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/media-server-downloads/#plex-app): Same as Jellyfin, but many of them are not free.
- [Ubooquity Webapp](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/): Ubooquity has it's own webapp built in to the server software, same with Jellyfin and Plex.
- [Kuboo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sethchhim.kuboo&hl=en_GB&gl=US): 👑 Reader for Ubooquity, available for android.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/): Meant to be a very good comic reader. Apparently has functionality to be both a player and a server. Personally I wasn't very fond of it.
- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org): 👑 Quite possibly the best comic reader I have ever come across. The app itself is nothing but a container for all the extensions that you can install that allow you to read comics from different sources. I use this for reading comics from my Komga server, and from online sources such as ReadComicOnline.to. There is a desktop version available called [Tachidesk](https://github.com/AriaMoradi/Tachidesk), however it is unofficial and a little bit buggy.
- [ComicPeeps](https://kitric.github.io/projects/comicpeeps/): A comic reader that I'm currently developing that allows you to read comics and manage your library. Only available on windows, however.
